                <p>Websites are viewed on many different devices, with different screen sizes, data requirements and
                    operating systems. Responsive design allows websites to be optimised for any device that accesses
                    the
                    website. Responsive design means that users don’t need to change the settings on their device to
                    accommodate different website layouts. Sometimes, it is abbreviated to RWD (Responsive Web Design)
                    and
                    it uses fluid grids, flexible images and media queries to adapt to different display requirements.</p>

                <p>'Flexbox' is an example of a software tool which helps developers to build responsive websites.</p>

                <p>The User Interface covers how the user interacts with the computer
                    through text, graphics (colour, layout, style), animations and auditory features on the screen.
                    Developing the UI involves an understanding of the users’ needs.</p>
                <p class='quote'>"The User Experience (UX)...is the application of design tools and techniques to
                    uncover
                    user goals and needs” (Dennis Kardys, Feb 2018)</p>
                <p>The User Experience (UX) is the “application of design tools and techniques to uncover user goals
                    and
                    needs” (Dennis Kardys, 2018). This encompasses everything that impacts on user satisfaction from
                    the
                    feel of the website, ease of navigation, how quickly it loads, to the relevance of content and so
                    on.
                    The emphasis is design for “usability” or “user friendliness”.</p>
                <p>The diagram (pictured right) created by Dan Saffer shows how the complexity of good UX design
                    supports a
                    strong user interface experience.</p>

                <h4 class="italica">Web coding languages</h4>

                <p>HTML is the abbreviation for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a computer language used to create
                    websites. It describes how a document should be displayed as a webpage by the browser, (the
                    structure, text layout and other elements (buttons, images)). It is the core language of the world
                    wide web.</p>

                <p>Stands for Cascading Style Sheet. This is a mark-up/coding language that tells browsers how to
                    display a webpage to the end user. It controls the style elements of a page, like the size, colour
                    and location.</p>
                <p>It is used to separate presentation from content. It’s a way of separating the presentation of a
                    webpage from its content. Structured content goes into the HTML document and the appearance goes
                    into the stylesheet.</p>
                <p>It is recommended by the W3C. CSS means that HTML can be simpler and tells the browser how the HTML
                    elements should be displayed.</p>

                <p>Web designers are responsible for specifying the ‘look and feel’ of a website, whilst web developers
                    design the code to build the website. Web designers will typically look at how to incorporate
                    company logo’s, branding, images, and usability whilst web development covers the technical side
                    and of how the website works at creating link pages etc. A web developer takes a design and
                    develops it into a website.</p>
                <p>Both designers and developers use HTML, CSS, etc. but developers look at technical issues in
                    greater depth. Increasingly, there is an overlap between the two roles due to improvements in
                    technology. </p>

                <p>Wireframing is used to provide a basic visual guide or blueprint of the user interface of a website.
                    Wireframes do not have any content; there are no fonts, colours or images and are just simplified
                    sketches of a page layout. They typically include navigational systems, interface elements and how
                    these work together.</p>
                <p>A wireframe acts as a functional prototype of a website but without the graphics. It is used to
                    make sure the foundations of the website are sound before any content is added. They are also used
                    to help designers convey to web developers how a website should be structured. Focus is on
                    functionality rather than aesthetics.</p>

                <h1>Cache</h1>
                <h4 class="italica">It's a clear out!</h4>

                <p>Is a type of temporary storage that a browser uses to download and store files of information about
                    websites that have been visited. The next time a user visits a website, the browser can load the
                    cache files, rather than from the original server, which can make the webpage load faster.
                    Sometimes the cache can hold onto an older version of the webpage and will need to be cleared if
                    any changes occur on a website.</p>
