            <img class="profile2" src='sources/profile_leadDev.jpg' alt="Leading Website Developer" width="168" height="140">
            <p>My name is Keir Mackenzie and I am the lead developer of this website design and I have also created the
                content.</p>
            <p>I am currently a first year undergraduate at University of Northampton, on the Computer Games
                Development BSc course, and Web Development is a key pillar of my degree. On this course, I am
                passionate about building user-friendly websites with an emphasis on accessibility.</p>
            <p>I come from a background in business computing from an apprenticeship at a local grammar school, where
                I achieved a level 3 in ICT Systems and Principles. In addition, I have a Level 3 Extended Diploma in
                Creative Media Production (Film) from Milton Keynes College, as well as having science and maths
                A-levels.</p>
            <p>I am drawn to Web Development because of my technical background which compliments the web development
                skillset, and my creative background which inspires the web design aspects of web development.</p>
            <p>I hope this website will inspire you to find out more about the exciting changes to website design and
                development!</p>
