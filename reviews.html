            <h3>Web Development Software </h3>

            <p>Dreamweaver is the market leader in web design tools and has gone through several iterations to be part
                of Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. It is a WSIWYG editor which means all the coding can be done in the
                background. </p>

            <h3><u>Pros & Cons</u></h3>
            <p>Pros<br>
            + Very popular web design tool<br>
            + Suitable for all levels of expertise</p>
            <p>Cons<br>
            - Sheer amount of features can be confusing
            </p><br>
            
            <p>It has a full range of functionality from beginner to advanced user – which can be specified at its
                first launch, which is very useful to prevent the sheer range of functionality overwhelming you.
                The tool has a well-designed UI with powerful features and is capable of supporting the majority of web
                codes HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc. In addition, it supports templates such as WordPress and Drupal.</p>
            <h4><u>Key features are:</u></h4>
            <p>Design environment - visual page layout, visual editing, application development<br>
                Coding environment - write and edit HTML, JavaScript, and any other codes<br>
                Direct edit of HTML elements with instant preview in same view<br>
                Live view allows a realistic preview of the website plus allows interaction as if in browser</p>
            <p>If you are beginning to program with raw code, Dreamweaver also offers tips to tweak code. At the other
                end of the experience scale, whilst there are advanced features such as”live view” to preview websites,
                as well as support for certificates and a workspace for developers.</p>
            <p>This is a very flexible website design tool that will grow with a developer’s skills, but could be
                potentially overwhelming for beginners.</p>

            Wix uses intuitive drag and drop interfaces that allow users, without prior tech /coding experience to
            build business websites either using:
            WIX ADI
            Automatic site creation using ADI Artificial Design Intelligence or a template. uild a site based on
            business and logo colours and then user can change boiler plate text etc
            Or WIX Code ( API/JavaScript features)
            New Wix Code feature lets novices and programmers alike build dynamic web applications Wix Code consists of
            five tools—Databases, Dynamic Pages, External APIs, Forms, and Managed JavaScript, to extend website
            functionality
            Responsive design Website design is mobile friendly although doesn’t feature “responsive design” and there
            are good mobile site building tools. Wix sites aren't responsive in the strictest sense but Wix produces
            mobile versions of your sites that pass Google's test for mobile-friendliness..
            All Wix websites are ‘Search Engine Optimised’</p>
