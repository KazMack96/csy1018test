            <h2>Review #1: Web Software</h2>
            <p>When it comes to the design of a website, one of the easiest ways to create a basic home page is with a
                simple notepad document. Notepad, on Windows 10, is a free note editor that is built-in to Windows 10.
                IF the aim is to develop a website to a more professional standard, programs like Atom and VS Code are
                free to download and even allow the use of several plugins built specifically for them.</p>
                <img src = ''>
            <p>When it comes to designing a webpage with a bit more visual control over programming, there some paid
                and free alternatives that can be found online. <a href='https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/dreamweaver.html'>Dreamweaver
                    CC</a> by Adobe being one of them. At first glance, the software is pay-to-use for "just Â£19.97" a
                month according to the website. Even if you're not willing to pay to use it, it does offer a free,
                30-day trial download instead. As part of Adobe's Creative Cloud, Dreamweaver allows the user to
                save their files to the cloud, so that it can be accessed on other devices.</p>

            <h2>Review #2: Web Design Services</h2>
            <p>Some web design services can be found online, granting users the ability to develop a website without
                taking up any storage space. Some services like Mozilla Thimble and <a href='https://www.codepen.io/'>Codepen</a>
                help with storing and using code, with realtime feedback of what the webpage will look like in a
                preview window. As much as these do allow a user to see if their code works, it does not make the final
                website publicly available. If having a public site is essential, services like <a href='https://www.wix.com/'>WIX</a>
                are a good place to start. WIX allows a user to design their website in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
                form (WYSIWYG for short).</p>
            <p>Even though WIX is a good source to start off a website, being mostly a WYSIWYG design
                service means it does have a basic HTML editor, but is meant to be used without the need
                for any coding. The layout of the website is neatly ordered for ease of use and the main website
                building system is neatly arranged so users will now what each part of their website will look like.</p>
