            <h3>Web Development Software </h3>

            <p>Dreamweaver is A visual development tool for creating, publishing, and managing websites and mobile
                content. It is the market leader in web design tools and has gone through several iterations to be part
                of Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. It is a WSIWYG editor which means all the coding can be done in the
                background. </p>

            <p><b><u>Pros</u></b><br>
                + Very popular web design tool<br>
                + Suitable for all levels of expertise</p>
            <p><b><u>Cons</u></b><br>
                - Sheer amount of features can be confusing
            </p><br>

            <p>It has a full range of functionality from beginner to advanced user – which can be specified at its
                first launch, which is very useful to prevent the sheer range of functionality overwhelming you.
                The tool has a well-designed UI with powerful features and is capable of supporting the majority of web
                codes HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc. In addition, it supports templates such as WordPress and Drupal.<br></p>
            <h4>Key features</h4>
            <p>> Design environment - visual page layout, visual editing, application development<br>
                > Coding environment - write and edit HTML, JavaScript, and any other codes<br>
                > Direct edit of HTML elements with instant preview in same view<br>
                > Live view allows a realistic preview of the website plus allows interaction as if in browser</p>
            <p>If you are beginning to program with raw code, Dreamweaver also offers tips to tweak code. At the other
                end of the experience scale, whilst there are advanced features such as”live view” to preview websites,
                as well as support for certificates and a workspace for developers.</p>
            <p>This is a very flexible website design tool that will grow with a developer’s skills, but could be
                potentially overwhelming for beginners.</p>
