            <img src='sources/dwcc.png' class='centerimg'><h3>Web Development Software </h3>

            <p>Dreamweaver is the market leader in web design tools and has gone through several iterations to be part
                of Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. It is a WSIWYG editor which means all the coding can be done in the
                background. </p>

            <p class='quote'>“A web design juggernaut but possibly overkill for some” (TechRadar 2018)</p>
            <p>It has a full range of functionality from beginner to advanced user – which can be specified at its
                first launch, which is very useful to prevent the sheer range of functionality overwhelming you.
                The tool has a well-designed UI with powerful features and is capable of supporting the majority of web
                codes HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc. In addition, it supports templates such as WordPress and Drupal.</p>
            <h4><u>Key features are:</u></h4>
            <p>Design environment - visual page layout, visual editing, application development<br>
                Coding environment - write and edit HTML, JavaScript, and any other codes<br>
                Direct edit of HTML elements with instant preview in same view<br>
                Live view allows a realistic preview of the website plus allows interaction as if in browser</p>
            <p>If you are beginning to program with raw code, Dreamweaver also offers tips to tweak code. At the other
                end of the experience scale, whilst there are advanced features such as”live view” to preview websites, 
                as well as support for certificates and a workspace for developers.</p>
            <p>This is a very flexible website design tool that will grow with a developer’s skills, but could be
                potentially overwhelming for beginners.</p>

            <p>Some web design services can be found online, granting users the ability to develop a website without
                taking up any storage space. Some services like Mozilla Thimble and <a href='https://www.codepen.io/'>Codepen</a>
                help with storing and using code, with realtime feedback of what the webpage will look like in a
                preview window. As much as these do allow a user to see if their code works, it does not make the final
                website publicly available. If having a public site is essential, services like WIX are a good place to
                start. WIX allows a user to design their website in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get form (WYSIWYG for
                short).</p>
                <img class='centerimg2' src='sources/ExpertMarket-WIXreviewRating.png'>
            <p>Even though WIX is a good source to start off a website, being mostly a WYSIWYG design
                service means it does have a basic HTML editor, but is meant to be used without the need
                for any coding. The layout of the website is neatly ordered for ease of use and the main website
                building system is neatly arranged so users will now what each part of their website will look like.</p>
